energy:
    avg_speed: 0.5 # m/s, needed in the beginning when the average cannot be computed because its very inacurate
    charge_time: 0.001 # hours needed for charging, 2.4h for P3DX
    moving_consumption: 22.3775 # watt
    standing_consumption: 13.2075 # watt
    battery_charge: 10 # Wh
    limited_energy: 1 # 1: robot recharges, 0: robot does not return for recharging
    battery_reserve: 20 # percent of battery charge to keep as reserve when traveling home to charging station (if euclidean distance is used)
